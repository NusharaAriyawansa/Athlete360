      <p>Serendib International Cricket Academy (SICA) was founded in 2013, by two professional individuals who had a vision to develop an internationally recognized cricket academy in Gampaha, the 2nd largest city in Sri Lanka. It has state of the art facilities that provide a high-performance coaching that not only caters for local cricketers, but also for cricketers from around the world. All the SICA Coaches are fully qualified with <strong>ICC Global Level 3, Australian Level 2, ICC level 1 and Sri Lanka Cricket Level 1</strong> to provide the finest coaching programs designed from junior to elite levels. We believe that every cricketer got natural talent in their genes that can only be discovered and nurtured with mindful cricket coaching, which is appropriate for each age limit and skill level. SICA was founded to discover and develop this talent by providing professional coaching for individual cricketers, teams, and coaches of various ages and experience levels, which includes women cricketers through <strong>Serendib Girls</strong> program.</p>
